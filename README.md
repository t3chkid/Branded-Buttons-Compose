# Branded Buttons 
Branded Buttons for compose is a library that contains buttons stylized according to the specification of each brand. It allows you to create high quality social sign-in, sign-up, and "continue with" buttons. For example, you can create a Google branded button with a label that displays "Sign up with Google". Just tell the library which brand and variant is required. The library takes care of creating a button with the required brand colors and logo.
